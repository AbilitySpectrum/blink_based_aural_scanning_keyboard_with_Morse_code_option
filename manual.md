##Aural Keyboard Manual

###Initial Setup

Before the application can be used, we need to register the eye’s normal position, up position, and down (shut) position. This is done by pressing **1**. 

Then adjust computer until the blue box is steady (with few or no beep) and the left eye appears in the box. Press **2**. 

With the left eye visible in the blue box, ask the user to roll her eyes up. Press **3**.

Press **4** when the eyes are down.

Look at the 3 pictures on the left hand side. If they are not clear or seem to have registered the wrong eye position, *press ***1*** to start over*.

###Running the program

Press **5** to run the program. The left eye should appear in the blue box at all times. If the program seems not to sense the eye properly, press 1 to re-start. 

The program cycles through ‘1’, ‘2’, ‘3’, ‘4’, ‘5’. If one of these is selected, it will cycle through the alphabet within that group. ‘5’ will let the user type a ‘space’, 'pause', delete a letter/word/line, go into Morse entry mode, sound call bell, or retrieve a previously stored line.


When 'delete' is selected, the user will be prompted for whether a letter, word will be deleted or the entire line erased. The 'erase text' option is first announced by a 'erase coming'.

Once a line of text reaches 30 letters, the next space will cause the line to be stored and a new blank line begins. The stored line could be retrieved (and wipe out the current line) using the 'Retrieve' option.


When 'pause' is selected, the program pauses for 3 minutes before 'waking up' and become active again. It can be unpaused manually by pressing **p**.

When 'use Morse' is selected, the program will go into Morse input mode. 6 short blinks will bring the program back to normal typing mode.

While in Morse input, a 7-unit 'eyes up' will delete a letter. Another 7-unit 'eyes up' will delete a word. A 12 seconds 'eyes up' will sound the call bell.

###Options 

**j** and **k** - Change pace: use **j** to slow down and **k** to speed up. The speed will be displayed from 0 (3 seconds between announcements) to 10 (<1sec).  When in Morse input, the same **j** and **k** keys will adjust speed for Morse as well.

**v** - voice feedback (on/off switch). With voice feedback, whenever a letter or menu is selected, a voice will repeat the selection.

**p** - pause and un-pause the program. 

**s** – sound feedback – a tone is sounded whenever the eye is rolled up

**a** - announcement of the menu and letters. When off, this makes the program unusable for typing, as you won’t know what is going on. However, combined with the s option on, this will let the user practice short and long blinks for Morse code (while in normal typing mode).

**Shift-R** – readies the call bell. Rings call bell when eyes are down for > 1 second.
